This book is not a popular science book. It is not a textbook. It is not an academic book. It is not even a chimera of the above.  

It does share some goals with the three: to inspire wonder (like a popular science book), to include some rigour (like textbooks), and to introduce readers to phenomena that might challenge their understanding (as academic works often achieve).

As with some combinations, like a sushi-pizza restaurant, it excels at none.  
The main exposition isn't long enough for full understanding, the technical part is often too abstract or detailed to follow, and despite claims of rigour, von Neumann's line that \textit{there's no sense in being precise when you don't know what you're talking about} fits too well.

But if my plan works, you'll get the appetite to leave this sushi-pizza diner. Maybe to a textbook because you're intrigued. Maybe to Wikipedia or blogs for more context about this fantastical world. That's the value: developing an appetite to dive deeper.

Few disclaimers.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The book contains errors ranging from typos to wrong equations. Please report them, and be forgiving of mistakes. While precision is unrealizable, this serves as a more accurate guide to reality than popular science books.

    \item All chapters can be read independently. The \textbf{essence} is accessible to anyone, mostly in the chapter summaries. Some chapters are extremely mathematical and may not appeal to unfamiliar readers. The exponential map and four-dimensional spacetime chapters are the most mathematical.
\end{itemize}

Most topics have personal stories behind them â€” I remember how I learned about them. \textcolor{pink}{I hope I can infect you with some of that excitement.}

Here we go.
