    \textbf{Superpermutation Watch Order:}  
    A viewer watches a three-episode anime in the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1. This sequence is a **superpermutation** for 3 elements â€” meaning it contains all $3! = 6$ permutations (123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321) as contiguous subsequences. The concept gained notoriety when an anonymous 4chan user solved the minimal-length superpermutation for 5 elements before mathematicians. \par
