General anesthesia is the only routine medical intervention that abolishes subjectivity itself. Other drugs alter perception, mood, or pain. Anesthetics suspend the condition for all perception and mood. A standard intravenous dose of propofol, typically two milligrams per kilogram, eliminates awareness in less than a minute. The transition is not gradual. One moment the subject tracks voices and surroundings, the next moment there is no report, no continuity of thought, and no subsequent memory. From the standpoint of practice, the effect is reliable, reversible, and indispensable. From the standpoint of theory, it remains unexplained.

Different drugs converge on this same endpoint through divergent and sometimes contradictory mechanisms. Propofol potentiates $\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA\textsubscript{A}) receptors, amplifying inhibitory currents and reducing excitability across the cortex. Isoflurane, sevoflurane, and other volatile anesthetics bind to multiple targets, including potassium and sodium channels, producing a generalized dampening of neuronal firing. Nitrous oxide and xenon inhibit $N$-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, reducing excitatory drive. Ketamine, paradoxically, blocks NMDA receptors yet increases cortical activity globally, producing electroencephalographic patterns closer to wakefulness than sleep, while still abolishing awareness. Distinct molecular actions, some that silence neurons and some that excite them, terminate consciousness with equal reliability. No unified account reconciles how these divergent perturbations converge on the same disappearance.

The search for such an account once looked promising. At the turn of the twentieth century, Hans Meyer and Charles Ernest Overton noted a striking correlation: the potency of an anesthetic scales with its solubility in lipids. The Meyer–Overton rule suggested that anesthetics acted by dissolving into neuronal membranes, altering their physical properties. For decades this rule dominated, reinforced by the simplicity of its formulation. Yet the correlation broke. ‘‘Non-immobilizers,’’ molecules with high lipid solubility, fail to anesthetize. Others, poorly soluble in fat, work effectively. The membrane theory could not account for exceptions.

Attention shifted to receptors. Different classes of anesthetics bind to distinct proteins, with GABA\textsubscript{A}, NMDA, and two-pore domain potassium channels among the prime candidates. Yet receptor theories also encounter anomalies. No single target is necessary. Mice engineered with GABA\textsubscript{A} subunits resistant to volatile anesthetics still lose consciousness when exposed. No single target is sufficient either: receptor agonists or antagonists with precise effects on candidate pathways often fail to produce general anesthesia. What remains is a map of partial correlates, not a law that specifies why awareness itself vanishes.

The opposite extreme demonstrates the same ignorance. Fatal familial insomnia, a prion disease, destroys neurons in the thalamus, especially in the anteroventral and mediodorsal nuclei. These nuclei regulate the architecture of sleep. As they degenerate, the subject loses the ability to enter non-rapid eye movement sleep. Ordinary fatigue accumulates, but sleep never arrives. Patients remain in escalating wakefulness until death, often within a year of symptom onset. Other neurodegenerative diseases erase memory, language, or motor control. This one erases the possibility of unconsciousness. Consciousness persists compulsively, until the body collapses under the weight of uninterrupted wakefulness.

Anesthesia and prion disease bracket the same mystery. In one case, milligrams of a synthetic molecule suspend awareness entirely. In the other, widespread neuronal loss fails to interrupt it. Consciousness is too easy to subtract and, at the same time, impossible to eliminate. The paradox indicates that the manipulations reach only the conditions under which consciousness manifests. They do not specify what consciousness is. Practitioners can toggle the switch. They do not know what is being switched.

The gap between control and understanding demands a broader frame. If physiology can be altered to produce or prevent awareness with precision, yet awareness itself remains undefined, then the question is no longer only empirical. It is epistemic. Consciousness belongs to a different category of truth than the physical correlates that accompany it. To analyze this category requires distinguishing truths by the cost of their revision, from the blue of the sky to the laws of physics, to arithmetic, and finally to agency itself. Only within that hierarchy can the singularity of consciousness be located.

Your Claims About Consciousness (full set)

Consciousness is singular, not parametric.
It cannot be reduced to features, functions, or classifier parameters. Consciousness is the standpoint from which features and functions are recognized, not an item among them.

Mechanistic origin-theories are self-undermining.
Any research program that seeks to locate the origin of consciousness in physical mechanisms presupposes the very phenomenon it attempts to explain. The attempt collapses into epistemological and ontological dead ends, because explanation already requires the presence of a subject.

Free will and physics appear incompatible, but the decision is asymmetrical.
If physics is complete, free will must be simulated. If free will exists, physics as a closed system is incomplete or itself simulated. Between these two exclusives, free will must prevail, because it is lived fact — the datum that makes any description of physics or simulation possible.

Consciousness is free will applied to thought.
Its essence is not just awareness of sensations but the deliberate capacity to hold, release, and redirect one’s own stream of thought. This is the active core of subjectivity.

Consciousness cannot be an illusion.
Illusions presuppose a subject that misperceives. To declare consciousness illusory presupposes the very phenomenon under denial. Thus, the claim is incoherent in the strong sense.

Levels of truth escalate by revision cost.

Appearances: the sky is blue; revisions are absorbed easily.

Physical laws: gravity, atoms, electrons; revisions require rebuilding ontologies.

Mathematics: $2+3=5$; revision would annihilate reasoning itself.

Agency: the fact of being a subject that directs thought; revision would erase the standpoint for any knowledge.

The highest level governs.
If truths at different levels appear mutually exclusive — for example, deterministic physics versus lived free will — the higher level dominates. Agency cannot be sacrificed to consistency with lower levels, because it is the condition that makes the very notion of “consistency” meaningful.

Consciousness is not an object among objects. It is the standpoint from which objects are disclosed and compared. Treating it as a parameterized target for classification or prediction misclassifies its category. To cast consciousness as a vector in a feature space or an output of a supervised learner assigns it the logical role of a datum, when in fact it is the precondition for there being data, features, and supervision at all. Models that tabulate correlations can succeed at prediction. They do not address what a subject is, or how agency over thought is exercised.

A precise account benefits from ranking commitments by their revision cost. The cost is not measured in surprise or inconvenience. It measures how much of the apparatus of knowing must be discarded if a given commitment fails. Arrange four tiers:
$$
T_0 \prec T_1 \prec T_2 \prec T_3 ,
$$
where $A \prec B$ reads: $B$ carries a strictly greater revision cost than $A$.

\textbf{Tier $T_0$: Appearances.} The world presents patterns: ‘‘the sky is blue.’’ A revision that reclassifies the appearance—scattering at short wavelengths, or an illusion induced by unusual optics—alters a report, not the capacity to report. The subject persists without strain.

\textbf{Tier $T_1$: Physical ontologies.} Gravity, fields, atoms, electrons organize causal expectation and technical practice. If those regularities prove to be artifacts of a simulation, the subject would rebuild the catalog of causes and effects. Days or weeks of cognitive reconfiguration might be required. The capacity to model would remain.

\textbf{Tier $T_2$: Mathematics and logic.} Arithmetic and inference rules organize thinking itself. If $2+3=5$ fails as a rule of combination, the instruments of comparison and correction collapse. The disruption is not empirical. It is cognitive. The subject’s capacity to measure disagreement dissolves because the grammar of disagreement no longer applies.

\textbf{Tier $T_3$: Agency and selfhood.} The fact of being a subject that directs attention and selects among candidate thoughts anchors all other tiers. The commitment is minimal and unconditional: a subject exists that exerts deliberate control over its stream of thought. If this fails, there is no standpoint from which failure could be registered. Nothing remains that can retain, revoke, or replace commitments.

The tiers admit a compact dramatic form:

\textit{I know the sky is blue. If a better account removes the blue, nothing essential breaks.}

\textit{I know there is gravity. If the plug is pulled and forces redraw, stunned for a time, then a new catalog of causes follows.}

\textit{I know there are atoms and electrons. If physics is replaced, weeks of reconstruction follow.}

\textit{I know $2+3=5$. If that is wrong, the machinery of thought caves in.}

\textit{I know I have free will. If that is wrong in the strong sense, the subject of thought is gone. No reconstruction is possible.}

This ladder fixes an order. Lower tiers describe states of affairs. The highest tier secures the existence of a knower. The higher the tier, the less it behaves like a proposition about the world and the more it behaves like a condition for there being a world-to-a-subject.

\textbf{Category error in reduction.} A common program flattens the ladder. It treats $T_3$ as if it were one more deliverable of $T_1$: identify neural correlates, measure firing statistics, map connectivity, fit parameters, and then name the trained map ‘‘consciousness.’’ Classification succeeds when the label aligns with the observation log. The success confuses correlation with constitution. A labeler can be excellent at telling when a subject is present. Excellence at labeling does not make the labeler the subject. The activity remains in $T_0$ and $T_1$: appearances organized by physical predictors.

\textbf{Parameterization cannot capture subjectivity.} A support-vector machine, a deep network, or any finite parametric learner instantiates a function $f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$. It extracts invariants and separates classes. The role of $f$ is classificatory. The role of subjectivity is first-personal presence and deliberative control. No change of basis, margin, or loss function turns classificatory role into first-personal presence. This is not a claim about capacity limits. It is a claim about logical type.

\textbf{Free will and physics.} Two readings are popular.

(1) \textit{Mechanistic sufficiency.} The total physical description in $T_1$ suffices. Agency is an illusion created by complex information processing. On this reading, the lived sense of choice reduces to patterns in neural trajectories, and free will is a narrative overlay.

(2) \textit{Transcendental agency.} There is a subject that exerts control over attention and decision. Physical description in $T_1$ may constrain, enable, or block, but it does not exhaust $T_3$. On this reading, agency is not a late product. It is a constitutive condition.

Only the second reading can play the role assigned to $T_3$. A constitutive condition cannot be downgraded to a deliverable of what it enables without a circle. A theory that denies $T_3$ disables the vocabulary in which denial is formulated. An illusion presupposes a subject for which an appearance fails to match a reality. If the subject is deleted, illusion-talk loses reference. The sentence ‘‘agency is an illusion’’ requires a subject that can contrast seeming with being. That requirement reinstates the very tier it denies.

\textbf{Revision cost made explicit.} Write the revision cost of a tier $T$ as $C(T)$. Let $C(T)$ measure the minimal loss of the apparatus of knowing incurred by abandoning $T$. Then:
$$
C(T_0) \ll C(T_1) \ll C(T_2) \ll C(T_3).
$$
The inequalities are strict. Dropping $T_0$ alters reports. Dropping $T_1$ alters causal prediction. Dropping $T_2$ alters the form of reasoning. Dropping $T_3$ annihilates the point of view from which alteration can be registered. The last inequality is decisive. It fixes a dominance principle: if $T_3$ conflicts with claims in lower tiers, $T_3$ must prevail, because only $T_3$ ensures that conflict and priority make sense.

\textbf{Neuroscientific mapping and its scope.} Neural recordings, lesion maps, anesthetic dose–response curves, and connectomic atlases deliver constraints on when the subject is present to itself, and how that presence couples to physiology. The scope is exact and valuable: conditions for manifestation. It is not the scope of $T_3$: the fact that there is a subject for whom manifestation and absence matter. The ladder separates the questions. ‘‘When does agency appear or vanish for an organism?’’ is a $T_1$ question about timing and mechanism. ‘‘What is it to be a subject that directs thought?’’ is a $T_3$ question about the point of view that makes timing and mechanism intelligible.

\textbf{Consciousness as deliberate control of thought.} A usable definition in this register is minimal and operational: consciousness is the exercise of will on one’s own stream of thought. The will here does not name metaphysical uncaused cause. It names deliberate selection among candidate continuations of thought: hold, release, redirect, compare, adopt, reject. The stream is the ordered sequence of tokened contents available for such selection. The subject is the locus at which selection is enacted. The definition does not compete with physiology. It fixes the role that physiological accounts must ultimately enable if they aim to describe a conscious agent and not only a behaving system.

\textbf{Compatibilism, incompatibilism, simulation.} The ladder analysis avoids slogan disputes by keeping roles distinct. If physics is closed under its laws, then $T_1$ may be complete for describing trajectories in state space. $T_3$ remains the condition that makes description, law, and state legible. Calling $T_3$ ‘‘illusory’’ changes labels and keeps the role. Calling $T_3$ ‘‘simulated’’ keeps the role and shifts the substrate that realizes it. In both cases, the presence of the role is non-negotiable. The label does not alter the dominance principle.

\textbf{Consequences for explanation.} Explanations come in three kinds across the ladder:

(1) \textit{Correlation}: reliable covariation in $T_0$ and $T_1$.

(2) \textit{Mechanism}: organized causal organization in $T_1$ that, when intervened upon, predictably changes $T_0$ outcomes.

(3) \textit{Constitution}: preconditions without which correlation and mechanism cannot be stated or evaluated. $T_3$ sits here.

A neuroscientific account that moves faithfully from (1) to (2) achieves genuine progress. The move from (2) to (3) is not a further step along the same axis. It crosses the axis into the conditions of intelligibility. The crossing is not achieved by adding parameters or data. It is achieved by distinguishing roles and refusing category drift.

\textbf{Why the last level must win.} The hierarchy is not a hierarchy of importance. It is a hierarchy of logical dependency. Any statement from $T_0$–$T_2$ presupposes a subject that can assert, doubt, compare, and revise. That presupposition is exactly the content of $T_3$. Therefore, in any conflict, $T_3$ has priority over $T_0$–$T_2$. The priority is not a preference. It is a constraint of sense.

\textbf{Clean boundary for future sections.} Nothing above denies that anesthetics can suppress report, that lesions can block decision, or that stimulation can bias choice. Those are $T_1$ facts about conditions under which the $T_3$ role fails to manifest. Mapping those conditions is a scientific task. It does not discharge the role itself. The ladder keeps the tasks distinct and prevents the reduction error that confuses access conditions with the subject to whom access matters.

Summary in the native register of the ladder:

\textit{Appearances can be corrected.}

\textit{Physics can be replaced.}

\textit{Arithmetic organizes correction and replacement.}

\textit{Agency secures the existence of the one who corrects and replaces.}

\textit{Therefore $T_3$ governs conflicts across tiers.}
