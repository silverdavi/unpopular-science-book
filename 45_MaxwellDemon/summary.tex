Maxwell's Demon, proposed in 1867, describes a thought experiment where a tiny being controls a door between two gas chambers, selectively allowing fast molecules into one chamber and slow ones into another. This sorting creates a temperature gradient from uniformity, seemingly decreasing entropy and violating the second law of thermodynamics. One resolution emerged through Landauer's principle (1961): the demon must erase information to continue sorting, and this erasure necessarily increases entropy by at least $k_B ln 2$ per bit, offsetting the entropy reduction from sorting.
