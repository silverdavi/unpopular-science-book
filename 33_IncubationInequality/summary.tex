A geometric puzzle about Gaussian probability stumped mathematicians for over 60 years: prove that convex sets that are symmetric around the origin have enhanced overlap under Gaussian measure — that P(A ∩ B) ≥ P(A) · P(B). The symmetry condition means if point x is in the set, so is -x. Despite partial results for boxes, ellipsoids, and slabs, the general case resisted all attempts. In 2014, Thomas Royen, a retired pharmaceutical statistician from a small German university, solved it using textbook methods: transforming to squared variables, applying Laplace transforms, and checking matrix determinants. His proof, published in an obscure journal, went unnoticed for years. The breakthrough demonstrates how longstanding problems sometimes yield not to new machinery but to fresh perspectives on familiar tools.
