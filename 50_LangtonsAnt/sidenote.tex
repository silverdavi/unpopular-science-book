  \begin{itemize}
    \item Responsiveness: easy to score, easy to fool (covert command following exists).
    \item EEG complexity (LZc): tracks depth, not content.
    \item PCI (TMS-EEG): robust across agents, limited by stimulation access and modeling.
    \item Pupils, autonomics: sensitive to drugs and pain, not awareness per se.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Ketamine in one line:} high-frequency power up, effective connectivity down, report absent or dissociated.

  \textbf{FFI sketch:} PRNP D178N + met129 haplotype; thalamic degeneration; insomnia \(\to\) dysautonomia \(\to\) death.
