The Hough transform detects geometric patterns in images by converting the problem from image space to parameter space. Digital images undergo gradient-based edge detection to identify significant brightness transitions. Each edge pixel then "votes" for all possible geometric structures that could contain it. For line detection, edge point generate constraints in parameter space through the relation $b = y_0 - mx_0$. Points lying on the same line create intersecting lines in parameter space, forming accumulator peaks. This approach extends to other parametric shapes.
