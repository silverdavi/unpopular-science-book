ABSTRACT
A perceived problem with the standard flat-lambda model is that in the far future
spacetime becomes an exponentially expanding de Sitter space, filled with GibbonsHawking thermal radiation, and given infinite time there will appear an infinite number
of Boltzmann Brains (BBís) per finite co-moving volume today. If BBís outnumber
ordinary observers by an infinite factor, why am I not one? This Gibbons-Hawking
thermal radiation is observer dependentódue to observer dependent event horizons.
Different observers moving relative to each other will see different photons, and different
BBís. I will argue that the only particles that are real are the particles dredged out of the
quantum vacuum state by particular real material detectors. (In much the same way,
accelerated detectors dredge thermal Unruh radiation out of the Minkowski vacuum due
to their observer dependent event horizons.) Thus, I may see a thermal BB, but cannot
be one. Observer independent BBís can be created by quantum tunneling events, but the
rate at which ordinary observers are being added to the universe by tunneling events to
inflating regions exceeds the rate for producing BBís by tunneling by an infinite factor. I
also argue that BBís do not really pass the Turing test for intelligent observers. Thus, the
standard flat-lambda model is safe.
1 INTRODUCTION
The invasion of the Boltzmann Brains has become a perceived problem for the standard
flat-lambda model. In the far future the standard flat-lambda model becomes dominated
by the lambda term and approaches an exponentially expanding de Sitter geometry:
ds2
 = -dτ
2
 + ro
2
cosh2
(τ)(dχ2 + sin2
(χ)[dθ2
 + sin2
θdφ2
]) (1)

where ro = (3/Λ)
1/2.
This de Sitter geometry can be partially covered by Schwarzschild coordinates centered
on a particular geodesic observer:
ds2
 = - (1 ñ r2
/ro
2
) dt2
 + (1 ñ r2
/ro
2
)
-1 dr2
 + r2
(dθ2
 + sin2
θ dφ2
) (2)
There is an event horizon at r = ro, and because of this an observer at r = 0 will observe
Gibbons and Hawking (1978) radiation at a temperature of T = 1/2πro. The Hadamard
function tells us that a material detector located at rest at r = 0 will come into thermal 
equilibrium and attain an equilibrium temperature of T = 1/2πro. If it is an atom its
energy levels will become populated with a Boltzmann distribution at that temperature.
An observer at the origin will observe isotropic thermal radiation with a temperature of T
= 1/2πro at rest with respect to himself. From a thermal distribution one expects
occasionally thermal fluctuations to produce Boltzmann Brains (as complex as a human
brain). While these are exponentially rare, if one waits long enough one will eventually
see one (since the de Sitter state lasts forever). Various authors have estimated how long
one would have to wait on average to see one: Tav ∼ exp(1050) (cf. Linde 2007). Dividing
by the volume within the event horizon (the volume out to r = ro) which is 8π2
 ro
3
 gives
the probability per unit four-volume of producing a Boltzmann Brain: dP/dV4 = 1/(8π2
ro
3
Tav) which is finite. Consider a finite co-moving volume of our expanding universe
today [say (1 h-1 Gpc)3
] which will harbor by definition a finite number of ordinary
intelligent observers like ourselves. In the infinite future this region will expand by an
infinite factor as the lambda term comes to dominate and ultimately it will achieve an
infinite four-volume in the infinite future. Therefore it should harbor by the above
argument an infinite number of BBís. Therefore BBís should outnumber ordinary
observers like us by an infinite factor. So why am I not a BB?
A number of authors have proposed different solutions to this problem, as we shall
discuss. The Boltzmann Brain problem is sufficiently serious that it has prompted Hartle
and Srednicki (2007) to question whether we are typical, but all the other authors
considering this question have implicitly assumed the Copernican Principleóor the
Principle of Mediocrity as Vilenkin has sometimes called it. As laid out by Gott (1993)
this runs as follows: the Copernican Principle states that it is unlikely for your location in
the universe to be special among intelligent observers. Why? Because out of all the
places for intelligent observers to be there are by definition only a few special places and
many non-special places, so you are simply likely to be at one of the many non-special
places. I defined an intelligent observer as one who is self-conscious, able to reason
abstractly create art, etc., and ask questions like ìHow long will my species last?î, or
equally ìWhere am I in the Universe?î or ìAm I an ordinary observer or a Boltzmann
Brain?î
It is worth noting that the Copernican Principle has been one of the most successful
scientific hypotheses in the history of science. When Hubble discovered that other
galaxies were fleeing from us in an isotropic fashion, it could have been because our
galaxy was in the center of a finite spherical explosion, but after Copernicus we were not
going to fall for thatówe couldnít be at a special place at the center of the universe. No,
if it looked like that to us it must look that way from every galaxyóour location should
not be special. That led to the homogeneous, isotropic big bang models which led to
Gamow, Herman, and Alpherís prediction of the cosmic microwave background radiation
which was later discovered by Penzias and Wilson. It was one of the greatest predictions
ever to be verified in the history of science. All because of taking very seriously the idea
that our location should not be special (cf. Gott 2001 for more discussion). We use the
Copernican Principle all the time. Today, whenever we examine the cosmic microwave
background we assume we are looking from a random location in space. Indeed, in 
examining the results from a scientific experiment we routinely assume that we are
looking at a typical sample and not a particularly ìluckyî sample.
Page, in a talk in Cambridge England in 2001, favored the idea of regarding oneís current
conscious perception as chosen randomly from all conscious perceptions. (In that case I
then might have to wonder why I am not an ant. There are 1015 of them on Earth, and
they outweigh human beings, and so even though their brains are small might have a
comparable number of perceptions in total.) I would argue instead that one should regard
my current intelligent observation as drawn randomly from the intelligent observations
made by intelligent observersóobservers able to formulate such questions as ìam I an
ordinary observer or a BB?î I must be an intelligent observer to participate in this
discussion and so, by the Copernican Principle, my intelligent observation should not be
special among such intelligent observations. That is the viewpoint I will take here: My
intelligent observations are not special among those made by intelligent observers in the
universe.
If BBís outnumber ordinary observers by an infinite factor, then if I am not special then I
should likely be a BB. (Mind you most BBís make only one observation before
expiringóbut if they outnumber ordinary observers by an infinite factor that does not
matter, their observations would also dominate the total, making my current observation
special as well.) Since I am not a BB, something must be wrong. (I would note that the
great majority authors considering this problem have been in agreement that the
Copernican Principle should be upheld here and that we should not be among a finite
number of ordinary intelligent observers in our co-moving volume if an infinite number
of BBís brains occur later. In particular, no one considering the problem has argued that
the BBís do not count because they do not exist yet, for example--a point that would be
irrelevant in the multiverse in any case, where many de Sitter phases like the present one
have preceded our own.) With the exception of Hartle and Srednicki, the many authors
considering this problem have taken the spacetime view that we should be typical among
intelligent observers, wherever or whenever they occur. I will take that point of view
here.
One solution to this problem (cf. Dyson, Kleban & Suskind [2002]) has been proposed by
Page (2006). It is the rather dramatic conclusion that the cosmological model must
therefore be wrong. The de Sitter phase must not last forever. The de Sitter phase is
unstable via tunneling to the formation of bubble universes of lower vacuum density.
Within this infinitely expanding inflationary sea, an infinite number of bubble universes
of lower density vacuum state can form (cf. Gott 1982). Each bubble wall accelerates
outward with constant acceleration (because the density within the bubble is less than the
density outside and the pressure is less negative than outside, so the extra negative
pressure from outside pulls the bubble wall outward), giving it the shape of a hyperboloid
of one sheet in spacetime. At late times the bubble wall expands at nearly the speed of
light, but the forming bubbles fail to percolate and fill the space if the bubble formation
rate per four-volume is less than a critical value [which must be less than 0.24 ro
-4 ](cf.
Guth and Weinberg 1982, Gott and Sattler 1984). Dark energy we suspect is in the form
of an effective cosmological constant, a vacuum energy density of V(φ) sitting at a local 
minimum giving an effective lambda term today, where φ is a scalar field for example.
This may not be the global minimum. In fact, there may be many minima, with values of
V that are smaller than the current one. These may be either positive (leading to other de
Sitter bubbles) or zero (leading to bubbles with Minkowski vacuum inside) or negative
(leading to bubbles with anti-de Sitter vacuum inside). Conventional wisdom says the
negative density anti-de Sitter bubbles are sterileósince they resemble open cosmologies
that although initially expanding, recollapse after a short finite time. If these other lower
density vacuums exist, after long enough time the solution will tunnel to one of them and
a bubble of lower density vacuum will form. The formation rate of lower density
vacuum density bubbles per unit four-volume ro
4
 is expected to be exponentially small
due to the exponentially small barrier penetration probability. In this situation the
bubbles do not percolate, and the de Sitter phase continues forever, leading to the BB
situation. Page proposes that, instead, the bubble formation probability is higher than the
critical value for percolation, that is, of order 1/ ro
4
 or greater. That means that the de
Sitter phase will end in about 20 billion years. Page specifies tunneling to nothing, with
bubbles of nothing expanding to percolate and end the de Sitter phase in 20 billion years.
If the de Sitter phase is not ended by then (if the bubble formation rate is lower) then the
bubbles do not percolate and there is no stopping the de Sitter phase expanding forever
and the BB situation arises. To achieve Pageís result, the bubbles would either have to be
filled with nothing or sterile universes and the barrier penetration probability would have
to be surprisingly small.
Another possibility, perhaps more easily realized would be to simply adopt the cyclic
model of Steinhardt & Turok (2002) a point that has been independently noted by Carlip
(2007). In the cyclic model the current de Sitter phase ends with reheating and the
formation of a new big bang cycle after only a finite period of say a trillion years. That
gives a finite four volume for the de Sitter future of our piece of co-moving volume, of
say (1 h-1 Gpc)3
, and given the exponentially small probability of finding a BB in that
finite region one would not expect on average for any BBís to appear in this region.
Therefore the BB problem is solved. Is the fact that I am not a BB evidence favoring the
Steinhardt & Turok model? Alternatively, there may instead be a slow variation of the
fundamental constants (Carlip [2007]), or a slow fall off in V(φ) as it rolls down a hill to
zero, ending the de Sitter expansion.
Still another possible solution to the BB problem (discussed by Linde [2007]) would be
to note that in inflation new bubble universes are forming all the time in an inflating sea.
If you slice spacetime along a hypersurface of fixed proper time, you will find, at the
epoch we are at, exponentially more young bubble universes--filled with ordinary
observers--than old ones already in the de Sitter phase filled with BBís. Since the
inflationary timescale is so shortóof order 10-34 sec, universes that are younger by a time
∆t, are more common by a factor of exp(3∆t/10-34 sec) than older ones. Since 10-34 sec is
so short, the many newly formed ordinary observers dominate over the few BBís at a
given epoch and the BB problem would be solved, since in eternal inflation each and
every epoch is identical. A problem with this solution is the youngness problem. In
other words I should find myself very early in my universe. It would make it likely for
me to be the first member of my intelligent species which itself should be formed very 
early in the history of the universe, since universes in which intelligent species were first
forming should vastly outnumber [by a factor of
exp(3∆t/10-34 sec)] older ones where intelligent species were already formed at some time
∆t in the past. I find myself formed some 200,000 years after the formation of my
species and some 13.7 billion years after the big bangóso this formulation must be
incorrect. Thus, Linde argues that instead of counting probabilities one should count
probability fluxes.
Measures relying on a single time slice in the multiverse have been criticized by Vilenkin
(1995) and Aguirre, Gratton & Johnson (2006) on the grounds that the results depend on
the time slice. If slices of constant proper time are taken, one reaches after a while, one
stationary solution, while if one uses slices of constant Hubble expansion time, one gets
after a while another different stationary solution with different relative probabilities for
formation of different types of pocket universes.
Vilenkin (2006) instead proposes that one should compare the rate at which equilibrium
de Sitter BB fluctuations occur per unit four-volume in de Sitter space with the rate per
unit four-volume that new inflating universes are formed--multiplied by the number of
observers formed in each inflating universe by non-equilibrium processes later. Garriga
and Vilenkin (1998) have noted that bubbles of higher than the de Sitter density can form
by tunneling. Such a bubble has a higher vacuum density inside and a more negative
pressure inside than outside, and so begins to collapse, but if its initial radius is larger
than ro even as the collapsing bubble wall approaches the speed of light, the wall is not
able to complete the collapse because the outside space is expanding so fast. The
collapsing bubble reaches an asymptotically fixed co-moving size in the outside space
and thus grows to infinite size in the infinite future. Since each such inflating bubble will
create a new region of inflationóa new inflating seaówhich will expand indefinitely, it
will create an infinite number of ordinary pocket universes like ours, and an infinite
number of ordinary intelligent observers. Aguire, Gratton, & Johnson (2006) have noted
that another process for forming an inflating region is quantum tunneling to a
Schwarzschildóde Sitter geometry with an inflating region on the other side of an
Einstein-Rosen bridge (the geometry discussed by Farhi, Guven, & Guth [1987] for
creating a universe in the lab). The probability for forming this wormhole is
exponentially small but the inflating region can expand forever and give rise to an infinite
number of pocket universes and an infinite number of ordinary observers. The
probability of forming a BB in de Sitter space is exponentially small, and the probability
of forming a new inflationary region (at the grand unified density) is also exponentially
small but the inflating region produces an infinite number of ordinary observers by nonequilibrium processes later and thus the number of ordinary observers outnumbers the
number of BBís by an infinite factor. I am therefore likely to be an ordinary observer.
The fact that there is a time delay in forming the ordinary observers whereas the BB
forms at once, is not important Vilenkin argues. On the other hand, the new inflating
region will also create new de Sitter regions in which an infinite number of BBís are also
createdóand new inflating regions ad infinitum. So if delay is not important then where
does one stop? Vilenkin calls a stop by only counting the number of observers created by
non-equilibrium processes later. Thus the equilibrium fluctuation producing a BB gets a 
weight of 1, while the tunneling event giving rise to inflation gets an infinite weight
because it produces an infinite number of ordinary observers by non-equilibrium
processes later. The BBís produced later (in de Sitter phases) by the new inflationary
region donít count because they are not formed by non-equilibrium processes. Of course,
that might give the original BB a weight of 0 instead of 1, because it is not formed from a
non-equilibrium process either. This prescription seems unfair to the BBís. I am an
observer formed by non-equilibrium processes, so it seems to unfairly count only
observers (like me) formed later by non-equilibrium processes while not counting
thermal BBís formed by equilibrium processes later. If BBís can be formed by
equilibrium processes later due to the formation of the new inflating region, then why
shouldnít they also count?
Inflation also produces a de Sitter geometry and a spacetime filled with much hotter
Gibbons & Hawking thermal radiation, so why are BBís not a problem in the inflationary
stage that proceeds our own? The reason is that the e-folding time is small (10-34 sec) so
the event horizon has a circumferential radius of only ro ∼ 3 x 10-24 cm. This is too small
to make a causally connected intelligent observer. Bousso & Freivogel (2006) note that
BBís are most frequently produced in string landscape vacuua where ro ∼ 1 m, just large
enough to contain a reasonably complex BB. The average time to encounter a BB in
such a vacuum is Tav ∼ exp(1045) they argue.
Bousso and Freivogel (2007) have a different approach to the counting problem. They
argue that one should take a more local approach and examine what one eternal observer
would observe. Just as the quantum state is defined outside a black hole, they argue the
quantum state can be defined inside the event horizon in de Sitter space. One eternal
observer, traveling on a geodesic (i.e. sitting at rest at r = 0) will see the static
Schwarzschild metric in equation 2, out to the event horizon. The proper question
Bousso and Freivogel argue is how many BBís would that eternal observer see, given an
infinite amount of time. If the probability for formation of a new inflating bubble per
unit four-volume is larger than the probability of forming a BB, the eternal observer will
typically see the de Sitter phase end, and will pass into the new region before
encountering any BBís at all. Earlier he would have encountered a finite number of
ordinary observers, so they would by his counting outnumber BBís. The probability of
forming a new inflating bubble and a BB are both exponentially small and it is not clear
which process would win, but this at least offers a hope of solving the BB problem. (One
difficulty with the eternal observer approach as pointed out by Aguirre et al. 2006 is that
eternal observers will miss seeing new inflating regions formed by the Farhi, Guth, and
Guven, creation of a universe in a lab mechanism, and thus will unfairly not count them
when evaluating the frequency of different types of vacuum regions.) But by focusing on
how many BBís are seen, Bousso and Freivogel (2007) have taken an important new
tack, a viewpoint I will find valuable in one way as indicated below. However, one may
note, that while the space visible to a single eternal observer remains of fixed volume per
unit time (a spacetime cylinder with radius of the event horizon) the actual co-moving
volume beyond this is expanding exponentially with time, so many BBís are hiding
beyond the event horizon. And the question is why am I an ordinary observer rather than
a BB? Not whether I could see a BB, but whether I could be one. As the material 
particles in our co-moving volume thin out exponentially, they will only be able to see an
infinitesimal fraction of the whole future co-moving volume (within their individual
event horizons). Almost all of the BBís would remain hidden behind these event
horizons, like birds in a rainforest unseen by birdwatchers. Do they count? Could I, as a
random intelligent observer be a BB alone and unseen in de Sitter space? Remember, the
intelligent observer only has to be self-consciousóand is not required to be seen by
others.

2 UNRUH RADIATION
Suppose instead of finding ourselves in a universe dominated by dark energy, we found
ourselves in an open universe with zero cosmological constant and Ωm < 1. Then the
universe would expand forever and at late times would approximate a Milne cosmology
with metric:
ds2
 = -dτ
2
 + a2
(τ)[dχ2
 + sinh2
χ(dθ2
 + sin2
θ dφ2
)] (3)
where a(τ) = τ (the expansion becomes linear as the universe approaches zero density)
Setting t = τ coshχ, z = τ sinhχcos θ, y = τ sinhχ sinθcosφ, x = τ sinhχ sinθsinφ (4)
we find: ds2
 = - dt2
 + dx2
 + dy2
 + dz2
 (5)
which is a Minkowski metric, as expected, for it is an asymptotically flat spacetime with
zero density and pressure. This is a spacetime which has a temperature of T = 0 in the
limit as τ → ∞. If this were the cosmology we were living in there would be no worry
over BBís. With a temperature of zero, in this spacetime as τ → ∞, no one would be
worrying about there being any BBís. And yet we can find them if we go looking. The
origin of the Minkowski coordinates can be shifted to some late event in this space time.
Then establish new Rindler (1966) coordinates (T, σ, x, y):
where: t = σsinh(T/σo), z = σcosh(T/σo) where σo is a constant (6)
Expressed in Rindler coordinates the Minkowski metric becomes:
ds2
 = - (σ/σo)
2
 dT2
 + dσ2
 + dx2
 + dy2 (7)
In Rindler coordinates, the metric is static (the coefficients of the metric depend only on
the radial coordinate σ which measures proper distance from the origin). An atom on a
worldline with σ = const., is accelerated with acceleration a = 1/σ. Its worldline is a
hyperbola z2
 ñ t2
 = σ2
. It maintains a constant spacelike separation of σ from the origin.
An atom on this hyperbolic worldline will receive no light signals from events with t > z.
There is an observer dependent event horizon for this atom (the null surface t = z). The
Hadamard function shows the atom traveling on this accelerated world line will see
thermal Unruh (1976) radiation with a temperature TU = 1/2πσ = a/2π. The renormalized 
stress energy tensor is <Tµν>ren = 0, because we have the Minkowski vacuum state.
However the atom on the accelerated trajectory will see a Rindler vacuum state plus
Unruh thermal radiation: <Tµν>ren = 0 = <Tµν> thermal + <Tµν>Rindler vacuum. The Unruh
thermal radiation has a pressure equal to 1/3 the energy density (ρth ∝ TU
4 ∝ 1/σ4
) in each
direction, and so the Rindler vacuum has an energy density which is negative and a
negative pressure equal to 1/3 of that negative energy density. The accelerated observer
(or atom) will see Unruh thermal radiation plus a vacuum polarization whose Tµν is the
negative of that of the Unruh thermal radiation making the sum zero. The accelerated
observer will agree that the total renormalized stress energy tensor is <Tµν>ren = 0. He
just sees thermal photons that have been dredged up out of the Minkowski vacuum to
become real particles as far as he is concerned. If the accelerated atom is considered a
simple detector with two energy levels the occupation numbers will settle on the thermal
Boltzmann distribution N2/N1 = exp(-∆E12/kTU). The atom interacts with these thermal
Unruh photons. By the equivalence principle, this is as if the atom is at rest in a static
gravitational field (the Rindler metric is a static metric) immersed in a thermal bath. The
thermal bath this accelerated observer sees at a temperature TU has the usual thermal
fluctuations, and so very occasionally, he should see a BB. If he continues accelerating
forever, the thermal state will last forever and he will eventually see BBís. Of course it
would take an infinite amount of rocket fuel to keep him accelerating at constant
acceleration forever.
But here is the point. If an accelerated observer along a particular hyperbolic worldline
in Minkowski space would have detected a BB, would that BB still exist (and wonder
why it was a BB) if that accelerated observer (or atom) did not exist. I would argue that
that is not the case. The photons absorbed by an accelerated atom in Minkowski space
which cause one of its electrons to jump from one energy level to another are dredged out
of the Minkowski vacuum state by the accelerated motion of that atom. These are real
photons produced by the Unruh process and absorbed by the atom. But absent that
accelerated atom, the supposed division between Unruh radiation and Rindler vacuum at
a given event is observer dependent. The event horizon producing the Unruh radiation is
observer dependent. It depends on that accelerated observer (or atom in this case). A
different accelerated observer passing through the same event, whose acceleration was in
a different direction and of a different magnitude, would have a different event horizon
and would see different Unruh photons. A more highly accelerated observer would see
more and hotter Unruh photons. Absent that accelerated atom, those particular Unruh
photons are not real.
In special relativity, the time ordering of two events with a spacelike separation is
observer dependent, and there is no real answer as to which occurred first. Real things,
like the timelike or spacelike separation between two events as measured by the metric,
are those which are observer independent. So we should not think of all the possible
BB's in Minkowski space that could possibly be observed by all possible hypothetical
accelerated observers as real. What is real are the Unruh photons that are actually
detected by a particular real accelerated detector made of normal atoms. All observers
looking at that detector will see the detection. That is observer independent. 
3 OBSERVER DEPENDENT GIBBONS & HAWKING RADIATION IN DE
SITTER SPACE
The renormalized energy momentum tensor in de Sitter space for the Gibbons &
Hawking vacuum state is proportional to a small cosmological constant. For the case of a
simple scalar field (cf. Bunch & Davies [1978], Page [1982], Bernard & Filacci [1986],
Gott & Li [1998]):
 <Tµν>ren = -g µν(1/960π2
ro
4
) (8)
The Hadamard function shows that a geodesic detector will be in thermal equilibrium
with a thermal bath at a temperature of T = 1/2πro (Gibbons & Hawking [1978], Birrell &
Davies [1982]). With photons and gravitons and other particles included, the absolute
magnitude of this cosmological constant would be changed but the renormalized energy
momentum due to these fields would still be proportional to a cosmological constant
because a cosmological constant is the only thing that is de Sitter invariant. There can be
no preferred state of rest for the renormalized stress energy tensor, because the de Sitter
solution has no preferred state of rest. So we expect
8π <Tµν>ren = -g µν C1 ro
-4
 - gµνΛ (9)
Where Λ is the value of the cosmological constant produced by the V(φ) of the dark
energy. And C1 is a constant of order unity. This gives an effective cosmological
constant
Λeff = Λ + C1 ro
-4 (10)
Now to solve Einsteinís field equations we require ro = (3/Λeff)
1/2 so:
ro
-2 = [3 ± (9 ñ 4C1Λ)
1/2]/2C1 (11)
where we are interested in the smaller solution where
ro
-2 = (Λeff/3) ≈ (Λ/3)[1 + (C1Λ/9)] (12)
(cf. Gott and Li 1998 for discussion). The Gibbons & Hawking vacuum state makes a
slight correction to the cosmological constant Λ due to a scalar potential (V(φ)). A
geodesic observer stationary at r = 0 will see thermal radiation at a temperature T =
1/2πro at rest with respect to himself. These thermal particles (primarily photons and
gravitons of wavelength of order ro) will have a stress energy tensor <Tµν> = diag
(1,1/3,1/3,1/3)C2ro
-4 ∝ diag(1,1/3,1/3,1/3) T4
 where C2 is a constant of order unity. The
energy density in these photons is tiny. The total stress energy tensor seen by the
geodesic observer may be broken up into three parts: a cosmological constant 
term [(-g µν Λ) /8π], thermal radiation [diag (1,1/3,1/3,1/3)C2ro
-4], and vacuum
polarization [-g µν C1 ro
-4/8π - diag (1,1/3,1/3,1/3)C2ro
-4]. Together they add up to
[-g µν (Λ +C1 ro
-4)]/8π which is proportional to a cosmological constant and is de Sitter
invariant. All observers agree on this total stress energy tensor which enters the Einstein
equations. Our geodesic observer at rest at r = 0 will see thermal radiation that is at rest
with respect to him, and a vacuum polarization part that looks like a small cosmological
constant minus that thermal radiation. Another geodesic observer passing through the
same event as our geodesic observer with a velocity v with respect to him will observe
thermal radiation at rest with respect to her and will make a different division of the stress
energy tensor into thermal radiation and vacuum polarization parts. Our first observer
will see different photons than seen by our second observer. If the original observer were
to find a BB the second observer would not see that same detailed distribution of
particles. The two observers see different thermal photons. The thermal photons are
observer dependent because each observer has a different observer dependent event
horizon (one that surrounds their world line with a cylinder of circumference 2πro). If an
observer finds (rarely) a BB in the thermal radiation he sees, it is quite likely to be nearly
at rest with respect to him. Finding a BB in that thermal distribution with a high γ factor
would be even less likely, since it would require even more energy to produce. Another
observer traveling at high γ factor with respect to the first will observe a thermal
distribution of photons at rest with respect to her, and not see the same photons seen by
the first observer. The BB has a complicated brain whose intricate details depend on
incredible good luck in the photons and particles seen with small probability in that
thermal radiation (there will be a small probability in that thermal radiation for having
some baryons etc. and then ultimately a BB). The second observer flying by at high γ
factor will not see those same thermal radiation particles and will not agree that that BB
is there. The BBís that are seen (rarely) by individual observers are observer dependent
and therefore not real. What is real are the photons or particles that are actually detected
by the first observer. Any photons he detects, he has dredged out of the quantum vacuum
and registered on his detector and the second observer will see those changes in his
detector.
Suppose the first observer sees a BB waving at him and takes a picture of it. The second
observer will not see that BB but will see the photograph of it the first observer has taken.
Now consider the first observer. He has seen a BB waving at him. This could be
produced by a BB materializing out of that thermal bath and then waving at him, sending
photons with that view on their way to him. That would be a relatively rare event as
expected. But less rare, would be just those photons materializing out of that photon bath
headed toward him with that pattern. They do not have as much energy as the BB and
have less information in them than the BB itself would have. The Copernican Principle
tells the observer that he is not likely to be special among observers who have seen BBís
waving at them. Of all those observers, most have simply seen photons headed toward
them that look like a BB. So if you see a BB from a thermal bath you should conclude
that most likely it is just photons coming toward you that look like a BB rather than a BB
itself (which would be very much more unlikely). But it is even worse than that. The
photons and other particles that are not detected are observer dependent and would not be
seen by other observers. So there would not be agreement that they were real. 
In the everyday world, when we see a person waving it is most likely because there is a
person waving at us, rather than just photons in a lucky configuration headed toward us
looking like that. If we pick up a book in the library and read the first half of it and it
appears to be Hamlet, then it is quite likely that the second half of the book is the second
half of Hamlet. But if we are told that all the books in the library have been typed
randomly by monkeys, (which is the analogy with BBís) we would expect that the second
half of the book was most likely nonsense. Likewise, in the BB case, extrapolating
beyond the information we have actually detected, to more information beyond is not
usually justified.
So, Bousso and Freivogel seem to be on the right track in one sense. It is important what
is seen by real observers. So even when a BB is seen, it is only the detected photons that
are real and not the BB itself (which is observer dependent). Even if an observer sees a
BB, it does not mean that one is there (thinking its own thoughts).
Temperature in de Sitter space should be defined locally by observers and not globally
(c.f. Narnhofer, Peter & Thirring [1996]) because the observed temperature depends on
the acceleration of the detector. For example, consider an accelerated observer who is
stationary in the coordinate system of equation (1) at a radius r = const. > 0 where r < ro.
Such an observer will see a thermal bath (at rest with respect to himself) with a
temperature of T = 1/[2πro(1 ñ r2
/ro
2
)
1/2] (c.f. Gott 1982). If one constructs a rigid rod of
proper length L = 2roarcsin(r/ro) centered on the origin at r = 0, its ends will be
accelerated by the force applied by the rod so as to stay stationary at radius r from the
center in Schwarzschild coordinates (c.f. equation 2). Radiation traveling from the static
location r = r to the location r = 0 will redshift by the proper amount according to the
variation of goo expected in a static gravitational field so that arriving at r = 0 it will have
the proper temperature T = 1/2πro. As r → ro, stationary (accelerated) observers at r =
const. see T → ∞, and we approach the flat spacetime situation where a highly
accelerated observer has a hyperbolic worldline and sees Unruh radiation. Such an
accelerated observer will see hotter radiation, and will have a larger chance of seeing a
BBís. But again this is observer dependent radiation; different observers with different
velocities and different accelerations would see different photons. Different observers
will see different BBís and they would disagree about whether a BB was present at a
particular location. The only things that are real are observer independent-- things that
everyone can agree on.
[The black hole case is different. Hawking radiation which appears far from the hole is
observer independent because it arises from an observer independent event horizon (the
boundary of the past of future null infinity). The Hawking photons at large distance from
the hole carry energy away from it causing its mass to slowly evaporate. This will occur
whether or not those photons are ever detected. Those photons at large distances from
the hole are real (observer independent).]
In the case of de Sitter space, the thermal radiation seen by various real observers is
observer dependent and the only photons that are real are those actually detected by those 
real observersóthose are observer independent and leave a record. Those observers may
(occasionally) see a thermal BB, but the BB is not observer independent (therefore not
real) and is not an intelligent observer thinking about the encounter.

4 THE TURING TEST
Are we are violating the Turing test here? Turning proposed that if one had a
conversation with an entity [by typing questions], one should regard that entity as an
intelligent observer if one could not distinguish it from a human being. This is an
external behavioral test. So if an observer sees a BB and it passes the Turing Test,
shouldnít we regard it as an intelligent observer? If the computer HAL in 2001 could, by
repeated questioning prove indistinguishable from a human being, Turing would say
HAL should be regarded as an intelligent observeróand subject to the same protections
and rights as a human being. Our observer might have an extended conversation with the
BB he sees, asking it say 20 questions which would be answered appropriatelyójust as a
human would do. There is some tiny chance of finding that. (The answers to his
questions, which he can record on his computer, are observer independent and therefore
real.) But what happens if he asks a 21st question? According to the theory of BBís, most
BBís last only an instant before vanishing. They have very short lifetimes.
Exponentially rarely, one will find one that can answer 20 questions in a row as a human
would do, without vanishing or producing nonsense answers. This is, by definition, a
very special long lived BB. It is unusual among BBís. You have to be very lucky (or
equivalently wait a very long time) to see one. But BBís that will answer 21 questions in
a row are exponentially rarer than ones that can answer 20 questions in a row. Or more
precisely, getting 21 questions in a row correct from a thermal bath is exponentially rarer
than having it answer 20 questions in a row correctly. So by the Copernican principle, if
you are not special among those seeing a BB having just answered 20 questions in a row
satisfactorily, it is quite likely that you will see the BB failing to answer the next question
(the 21st) successfully. (Most BBís able to answer 20 questions canít answer the 21st.)
No matter how many questions are answered successfully, the BB you see is likely to fail
to answer the next one successfully (either by vanishing or by answering in nonsense).
The BB you see does not pass the Turing test, a test which allows you to continue asking
questions.
Indeed it is how I know I am not a BB. It might be argued, that if BBís outnumber
ordinary observers by an infinite factor, that I should be likely to be a BB. In fact, it
might be argued that I am in this case actually a BB. In other words, in this picture, all
the intelligent memories that I have accumulated up to now, should have been exactly
accumulated by an infinite number of BBís emerging from a finite co-moving volume in
our universe in the future. Then it could be argued, that for every ordinary me there are
an infinite number of BBís that have exactly the same mental processes and memories
and experiences that I have had up to this moment. Therefore, if I am not special, I
should be one of that infinite number of BBís. So how do I know that this is not true?
How do I know that I am an ordinary observer, rather than just a BB with the same
experiences up to now? Here is how: I will wait 10 seconds and see if I am still here. 1, 
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 Ö. Yes I am still here. If I were a random BB with all the
perceptions I had had up to the point where I said ìI will wait 10 seconds and see if I am
still here,î which the Copernican Principle would requireóas I should not be special
among those BBísóthen I would not be answering that next question or lasting those 10
extra seconds. BBís do not pass the Turing test for intelligent observers, so if I see one I
should not regard it as an intelligent observer.

5 TUNNELING
There is another way to make Boltzmann Brains in de Sitter space. It is via quantum
tunneling. Across a spacelike hypersurface the solution tunnels directly to a new
Schwarzschild de Sitter geometry which has a Boltzmann Brain mass sitting in the de
Sitter geometry. We can calculate the tunneling probability per unit four-volume
knowing geometry of the two solutions. The tunneling probability is exponentially small.
It can also be estimated by entropy arguments. The wait time for tunneling to produce a
10 kg BB is of order Tav ∼ exp(4 x 1069) (c. f. Bousso & Freivogel [2006]). This is a
permanent change in the geometry of spacetime that remains after the tunneling (which
has a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry corresponding to the 10 kg mass sitting in de
Sitter space). The Boltzmann brain may disintegrate after a short time, but the mass
making it up will remain afterward. (Making a BB out of the observed thermal radiation
in de Sitter space is a fluctuation in the energy in the observed thermal radiation, but this
may be in principle offset by a fluctuation lowering the energy level in the vacuum
polarization so that the total stress energy is not changed. Even if the total energy does
go up, consistent with the uncertainty principle, the fluctuation would go back down
quickly and in any case different observers would not see the same detailed BB. As we
have noted, such BBís are not observer independent.) The new BB created by tunneling,
however, can be observer independent, for its mass changes the geometry of spacetime
which everyone can agree on. This tunneling event adds one BB to the universe.
This tunneling event competes with other tunneling events which can also occur. Since a
BB is roughly of order 10 kilograms in mass, the probability of forming one per unit four
volume is similar to forming a 10 kilogram mass inflating ìuniverse in a labî by the
Farhi, Guven, & Guth [1987] tunneling mechanism, if the inflating state is near the
Planck density as would be implied by Lindeís (1983) chaotic inflation model.
There is also an exponentially small probability for tunneling to an inflating bubble state
that is at the GUT density. If this high density bubble is larger than the event horizon,
even though the walls of this region are being pulled inward at the speed of light, it will
inflate forever and create an infinite number of ordinary pocket universes like ours. In
either type of tunneling event, if the inflationary state is not metastable, according to
Lindeís (1983) chaotic inflation, it forms an infinite number of pocket universes like ours
by just rolling down hill without any other tunneling events. That produces an infinite
number of ordinary observers. In favor of chaotic inflation is the fact that the WMAP
results are consistent with a simple V(φ) ∝ φ2
 chaotic inflationary potential (Spergel et al.
2007). If there is either tunneling to a ìuniverse in a labî inflating state, or to a bubble 
inflating state of radius greater than ro (which we expect to be less likely), an infinite
number of ordinary observers will be created with no further tunneling events required.
(If the inflationary potential is metastable, the situation is more complicated. A tunneling
event is then required to form a single bubble universe from the inflating state. So we are
not comparing two tunneling events in a de Sitter space dominated by a cosmological
constantówhich is easyóbut rather a tunneling event in an inflating region versus a
tunneling event in a de Sitter space dominated by a small cosmological constant. Both
the inflating region and the de Sitter region dominated by a cosmological constant have
infinite four-volumes. One would then compare tunneling rates per unit four-volume.
Both are exponentially small. One tunneling event could produce one observer
independent BB, the other tunneling event would lead to formation of a bubble universe.
A single bubble universe would be open and produce an infinite number of ordinary
observers. But bubbles hit other bubbles, if the bubble in question joins a previously
formed bubble cluster then it will add intelligent observers of its own, but perhaps
subtract some that would have formed in other bubble universes had it not formed. On
average, of course, intelligent observers are created by this process. A cluster containing
an infinite number of bubble universes will produce an infinite number of ordinary
intelligent observers. Whether the number per bubble is finite or infinite would have to
be investigated. But it is large if the tunneling probability is exponentially small because
a large co-moving volume is created in each bubble universe before others hit it. In any
case, chaotic inflation seems to have the edge observationally with WMAP, so it appears
that these complications neednít be considered.)
We are interested in the rate new ordinary intelligent observers versus observer
independent BBís are being added to the universe by various tunneling events. We
should do this by multiplying the tunneling probabilities per unit four-volume in de Sitter
space by the change in ordinary intelligent observers (or observer independent BBís)
added by each tunneling event. The tunneling probabilities for producing a BB and for
producing an inflating region are both exponentially small, but the inflating region
produces an infinite number of ordinary observers as opposed to the one observer
independent BB. Therefore ordinary intelligent observers are being added to the universe
by these tunneling events at a faster rate than observer independent BBís. Now this is a
new version of Vilenkinís (2007) argument in full force. The qualms one had about it
before were that the inflating region produces eventually an infinite number of thermal
BBís also in later de Sitter phases, but now we know those BBís are observer dependent
and donít count as intelligent observers. So the tunneling event forming an inflating
region changes the future universe by adding intelligent observers in the form or ordinary
observers, but adds no new intelligent observers that are BBís. Future additional
tunneling events would be required to produce observer independent BBís. Here we are
calculating the rate at which ordinary intelligent observers and observer independent
BBís are being added by changes produced by the two types of tunneling events, so we
should consider only the changes that follow from these tunneling events, supposing no
future tunneling events were to occur. We then get the rate at which new ordinary
intelligent observers and observer independent BBís are being added to the universe by
those two types of tunneling events. The ratio of the tunneling probabilities is finite. An 
infinite number of ordinary intelligent observers are added by each inflationary tunneling
event versus only one observer dependent BB for a BB tunneling event. Thus, the
numbers of ordinary intelligent observers being added to the universe as a function of
time by tunneling events is infinitely large relative to the number of observer dependent
BBís added by tunneling events. (Thus, regardless of whether we regarded observer
independent BBís formed by tunneling as intelligent observers, I should still not be
surprised to be an ordinary intelligent observer.)

We should therefore expect ordinary intelligent observers to outnumber observer
independent BBís in the universe by a large (infinite) factor. Mind you an observer
independent BB, while real (because it is seen by all observers), still does not pass the
Turing Test, and may not be regarded as an intelligent observer. However one may have
a rarer tunneling event where instead of a BB one makes a huge mass with luckily just
the initial conditions to make an entire solar system. In such a solar system (living in de
Sitter space), intelligent life and intelligent observers may develop by ordinary
evolutionary processes on a habitable planet. These intelligent observers would be able
to answer a continuing sequence of questions and would pass the Turing Test and would
qualify as intelligent observers. I would call them ordinary observers who happened to
be born in a solar system that was not born in a standard inflationary big bang but one
that by tunneling suddenly found itself in an empty de Sitter space. I am not born in such
a solar system. And if I am not special then most solar systems harboring intelligent
observers should originate in standard inflationary big bangs rather than quantum
tunneling events. Recall that since a quantum tunneling event producing an inflationary
region produces an infinite number of universes and solar systems made from standard
inflationary big bangs, versus only one solar system made alone in de Sitter space from
its tunneling event, the number of big bang solar systems would outnumber solar systems
alone in de Sitter space by an infinite factor. I should not be surprised to live in a solar
system born in a standard inflationary big bang rather than in an isolated quantum
tunneling event. Inflation is just very efficient at producing solar systems and intelligent
observers so it wins.
6 SUMMARY
The Gibbons & Hawking thermal radiation that is seen by geodesic observers in de Sitter
space, and from which BBís are supposed to occasionally arise, is observer dependent.
Two geodesic observers crossing paths with a relative velocity difference will see
different Gibbons & Hawking photons. Each will see a distribution of photons at rest
with respect to themselves. They have different observer dependent event horizons and
see different photons. If one saw a thermal BB, the other would not be expected to
observe it as well. Arguably the only things that are real are the photons actually
detected by the real observers. If an observer takes a picture of a BB, which would occur
occasionally, the picture would be real and the photons that camera dredged out of the
quantum vacuum state would be realóand observer independentóbut the BB itself
would not. Just because you see a BB in de Sitter space, does not mean that it is thinking
about the encounter The BB does not count as an intelligent observer because it is 
observer dependent and does not pass the Turing test. It can be distinguished from a
human because even if it answers 20 questions successfully in a row, it will likely fail to
answer the next question. Real observer independent BBís can be created by tunneling
events in de Sitter space. These change the geometry of spacetime and are observer
independent. The rate at which new observer independent BBís are being added to the
universe compared to ordinary intelligent observers can be estimated by comparing the
(exponentially small) tunneling rate for creating a single BB to the (exponentially small)
tunneling rate to an inflationary state multiplied by the number of ordinary observers thus
created. With chaotic inflation, the one tunneling event to an inflationary state leads to
an infinite number of ordinary observers (and no new observer independent BBís) with
no further tunneling events. So the number of ordinary observers added by just that
tunneling event is infinite. Thus the number of ordinary observers outnumbers the
number of observer independent BBís being added by tunneling.
Therefore, the standard flat-lambda model, which has a de Sitter future, is not
inconsistent with the Copernican principle and the fact that I am an ordinary observer. I
might see a thermal BB but these are observer dependent so I could not be a de Sitter
thermal BB. Observer independent BBís formed by tunneling are infinitely rare
compared to ordinary observers produced by inflation. Even those observer independent
BBís fail the Turing test, so it could be argued that as an intelligent observer I could not
be one of them either. So with apologies to Gelett Burgess (1895), who wrote a similar
poem about a Purple Cow, I could sum up the situation as follows:
I never saw a Boltzmann Brain;
I never hope to see one;
But I can tell you, anyhow,
Iíd rather see than be one.
