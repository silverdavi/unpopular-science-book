The Jeiwsh calendar was developed for witnesses observing the new moon, but what happens when the new moon is not visible? When witnesses claimed they saw the new moon "in the morning east and evening west," Rabban Gamliel accepted their impossible testimony, then ordered Rabbi Yehoshua to violate his own calculated Yom Kippur — establishing that communal unity is more important than astronomical accuracy. The 922 CE Ben Meir controversy saw competing calculations threaten to split world Jewry over a 6-hour molad difference. From Arctic whalers to orbital Shabbat, each generation learns that "it is not in heaven" — religious law belongs to human authorities grappling with reality, not perfect celestial mechanics.
