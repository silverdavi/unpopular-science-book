# Summary Writing Rules for "Unpopular Science"

## Core Philosophy

Summaries serve as standalone "elevator pitches" that capture the essence of each chapter's phenomenon. They must be technically accurate while immediately conveying why the topic matters. Each summary should make the reader want to explore further without requiring prior knowledge.

## Structure and Length

**Target Length**: 3-5 sentences, approximately 60-120 words. 

**Density**: Every word counts. Pack maximum insight into minimum space.

**Flow**: Begin with the phenomenon, explain the surprising mechanism, then connect to broader significance.

## Content Rules

### Lead with the Phenomenon
Start with what is observable or counterintuitive, not with abstract concepts or historical context.
- ✓ "The yellow color of gold requires relativistic quantum mechanics to explain"
- ✗ "In 1905, Einstein developed special relativity, which explains..."

### Explain the Surprising Core
Identify the non-obvious mechanism or principle that makes the phenomenon remarkable.
- ✓ "Electrons in gold atoms reach 58% of light speed, causing changes in the 6s and 5d orbitals"
- ✗ "Gold has interesting properties due to physics"

### Quantify When Possible
Include specific numbers or bounds that make abstract concepts concrete.
- ✓ "Zhang proved there exists a finite bound B (initially 70,000,000)"
- ✓ "electrons drift at millimeters per second"
- ✗ "very large numbers" or "extremely fast"

### Connect to Broader Implications
End with why this matters beyond the specific phenomenon.
- ✓ "These everyday properties demonstrate how modern physics manifests in macroscopic observations"
- ✓ "This field-based transmission explains why circuits respond almost instantly"

## Language and Style Rules

### Active Voice and Direct Statement
Use active constructions and state facts directly.
- ✓ "Topological insulators exhibit an unusual combination"
- ✗ "It has been observed that topological insulators can exhibit"

### Technical Precision Without Jargon Overload
Include essential technical terms but immediately clarify their significance.
- ✓ "the Poynting vector (S = E × H), which describes energy flow"
- ✗ "the Poynting vector" (without explanation)

### Avoid Hedging
State established facts confidently without unnecessary qualifiers.
- ✓ "General relativity formulates gravity as spacetime curvature"
- ✗ "General relativity seems to formulate gravity as something like spacetime curvature"

### No Rhetorical Questions or Dramatic Setup
Get straight to the point without theatrical framing.
- ✓ "Arrow's Impossibility Theorem shows that no voting rule can..."
- ✗ "Have you ever wondered why democracy is so hard? It turns out..."

## Specific Patterns to Follow

### The Paradox Pattern
For paradoxical results: State the paradox → Explain the resolution → Note the deeper insight
Example: "The Banach–Tarski paradox shows... This construction depends on... While not physically realizable, the result reveals..."

### The Correction Pattern
For misconceptions: Common belief → Actual mechanism → Observable consequence
Example: "Electrical energy travels primarily through electromagnetic fields... not through the movement of electrons... This field-based transmission explains..."

### The Discovery Pattern
For breakthroughs: What was proven → How it was done → Why it matters
Example: "In 2013, Yitang Zhang proved... Zhang's approach combined... resolving a fundamental question..."

### The Connection Pattern
For interdisciplinary topics: Phenomenon in one field → Mathematical structure → Applications elsewhere
Example: "Poncelet's Porism describes... This geometric result connects to... The theorem exemplifies how problems in distinct fields..."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Overexplaining**: Trust that technical readers will understand implications.

**Underexplaining**: Don't assume familiarity with specialized terms.

**Biography Focus**: Minimize personal stories unless directly relevant to understanding.

**Process Description**: Focus on results and implications, not procedural steps.

**Vague Significance**: Be specific about why something matters, not just that it's "important" or "interesting."

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a summary, verify:
- [ ] Could a scientifically literate non-specialist understand this?
- [ ] Does it make clear why this topic deserves a full chapter?
- [ ] Is every sentence essential to the core message?
- [ ] Are concrete examples or numbers included where possible?
- [ ] Does it avoid all forms of sensationalism while maintaining genuine wonder?

## Examples of Excellence

**Best Opening**: "Topological insulators exhibit an unusual combination of properties: insulating in their bulk yet conducting electricity perfectly along surfaces or edges."
- Immediate, clear, intriguing

**Best Technical Explanation**: "Quantum mechanics allows particles to 'tunnel' through energy barriers they cannot surmount classically, with probability decreasing exponentially with barrier height and width."
- Complex concept made accessible without sacrificing accuracy

**Best Closing Impact**: "The theorem exemplifies how problems in distinct mathematical fields — from billiards to Gelfand's question about decimal digits — reduce to the same equations when expressed through appropriate frameworks."
- Shows deep connections without overstating
