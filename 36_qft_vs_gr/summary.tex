Physics' two most successful theories cannot coexist. Quantum field theory treats forces as particle exchanges on a fixed stage, while general relativity says the stage itself — spacetime — bends and warps. When combined, they produce catastrophic contradictions: QFT predicts vacuum energy $10^{120}$ times larger than observed, gravity refuses renormalization unlike other forces, and black holes seem to destroy quantum information. Each theory works perfectly in its domain — QFT predicts particle interactions to 12 decimal places, GR guides GPS satellites — yet they give mutually exclusive descriptions of reality. This incompatibility of theories is the most glaring problem in modern physics.
